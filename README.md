# yelp_tfidf
tf-idf (term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency) is a widely used metric for large datasets in order to determine the most relevant keywords. 
My program takes in a dataset from Yelp (attached), and it determines the top 30 keywords pertaining to each business in the dataset by using
the tf-idf metric. Since the dataset is quite large, my main method outputs this data among other criteria, for the top 10 businesses only (the ones with the most characters in their reviews). 


Simply modify the method "filtertop10()" if you'd like to see the data from a different number of businesses from the dataset.
Also note that you must modify the comparator "SortByReviewCharCount" to alter the order of the businesses to be outputted. Finally, IDEs such as intelliJ restrict the file size of attached .txt files. My code will run on much larger datasets, but only when operated outside of an IDE setting, ex. using Sublime.

To make this project, I made use of:

- Comparators
- Standard parsing techniques
- PriorityQueues (for efficiency)
- Input Streams from a file
